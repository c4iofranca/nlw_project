# Move-it Next.js
## Joining health and games

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You can clone this repository in your Visual Studio Code using HTTPS or SSH. 

Open VS Code, search for Clone Repository on the home screen and paste the address available in "Code", here on Github, and create a folder for the files.

Maybe ask for permission to connect Github to VSCode. 

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) in your machine.

First, go to the project folder:

```bash
cd <folder_name>
```

Then, install dependences:

```bash
npm i 
# or 
npm install
```

Now, you're able to run the development server: 
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
